1) DataStore integration tests should add relations:
  KVD: Resolved issue

  2) Collection#add should allow unsaved records into the collection:
    KVD: Tests expects results in particular order.. DctIndex doesn't return values in the same order as mindex.


  3) Collection#getAll should support complex queries:  
    KVD: Tests index with dual key fields.. DctIndex doesnt support multiple indexed keys

  4) Collection#getIndex should get an index:
    KVD: Test hard codes expected return datatype to JSData.Index
   

  5) Collection#remove should remove unsaved records:
    KVD: Resolved issue

  6) Collection#removeAll should remove unsaved records:
    KVD: Tests expects results in particular order.. DctIndex doesn't return values in the same order as mindex.


  7) Collection#removeAll should remove unsaved records with convenience method:
    KVD: Tests expects results in particular order.. DctIndex doesn't return values in the same order as mindex.


  8) Collection#updateIndex should update record in a single index:
    KVD: DctIndex doesn't support changing the records primary key once set.
	KVD: Test resets data[1].id = 3 when it's originally id: 1
	KVD: DctIndex does support the changing of the index value when it's a foreign key.
	KVD: 
	

  9) Collection#updateIndexes should update a record in all indexes:
	KVD: Resolved issue

  10) DataStore#defineMapper should create indexes for indexed properties:
    KVD: Tests expects results in particular order.. DctIndex doesn't return values in the same order as mindex.

  11) Mapper#create should nested create everything in opts.with:
	KVD: Non dictionary changes	

  12) Mapper#create should pass everything opts.pass:
	KVD: Non dictionary changes	

  13) Mapper#create should combine opts.with and opts.pass:
	KVD: Non dictionary changes	

  14) Mapper#createMany should nested create everything in opts.with:
	KVD: Non dictionary changes	

  15) Mapper#createMany should pass everything opts.pass:
	KVD: Non dictionary changes	


  16) Mapper#createMany should combine opts.with and opts.pass:
	KVD: Non dictionary changes	

  17) Mapper#createRecord should create records on nested data:
	KVD: Non dictionary changes	

  18) Query#between should work:
    KVD: Tests index with dual key fields.. DctIndex doesnt support multiple indexed keys
  	KVD:	ageRole doesn't exist
	 
  19) Record#hasChanges should return true if a tracked field is changed:
	KVD: Non dictionary changes
